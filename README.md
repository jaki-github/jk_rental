# jk_rental

This script allows players to rent vehicles (cars or bikes) in FiveM. To rent a vehicle, simply approach a designated NPC (Ped), interact with it, and choose your rental option. The rental price starts at a base rate and increases after 1 minute, doubling over time.

### Key Features:
- Rent cars or bikes from NPCs by interacting with them.
- Customizable rental locations: All coordinates can be edited in the `config.lua` file.
- Dynamic pricing: Set an initial price and configure the price increase over time (doubles every minute).

### Configuration:
- Modify rental coordinates and pricing settings in `config.lua`.
- Adjust the initial rental price and the rate at which it increases.
- You can add multiple places in `config.lua`.
